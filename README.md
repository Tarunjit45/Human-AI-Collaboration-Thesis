## Code

This repository includes the following code sections:

### 1. **AI Models & Algorithms**
   - **[ai_models.py]**: Python scripts for AI models used in the research (e.g., decision support systems, machine learning algorithms).
   - **[human_ai_collaboration_tool.py]**: Code for developing collaborative tools that integrate AI assistance in work processes.
   
### 2. **Data Processing**
   - **[data_preprocessing.py]**: Scripts for cleaning and transforming datasets used in experiments.
   - **[dataset_reader.py]**: Utility functions for reading and processing the datasets.

### 3. **Experiments & Analysis**
   - **[run_experiment.py]**: Scripts for running experiments to evaluate human-AI collaboration in various sectors.
   - **[metrics.py]**: Code for calculating performance metrics and analyzing results.

Each script is self-contained and includes comments for ease of understanding.
